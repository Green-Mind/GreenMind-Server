# Green Mind

DSC Solution Challenge

* project period: 2020/02/17 ~ 2020/04/30

  

## Project Description

The number of self-injury among young Korean youth is rapidly increasing. You can diagnose your condition more easily by using an Android application that is easily accessible to teenagers. And I wanted to make an app that provides a solution so that I can receive treatment without visiting the institution directly. Youth who want to be aware of their condition or who are reluctant to visit the institution directly can easily send results to the institution and receive counseling and treatment.
